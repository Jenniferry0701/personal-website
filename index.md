## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="image.jpg">

Hi! I'm Yujia. I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Harini Suresh](https://harinisuresh.com/). Previously, I did my undergrad at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). 

My research investigates the social impacts of AI systems through a sociotechnical perspective. I focus on co-designing grassroots, participatory, commuity-driven AI-based systems that are developed with and owned by marginalized communities. Currently, I am exploring the intersection of AI and Journalism, especially in ways to improve and shift mainstream narratives that perpetuate systemic inequalities. 

Outside of research, you can find me bouldering in climbing gyms, doing pottery, or hanging out with my cats.
