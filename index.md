## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="image.jpg">

Hi! I'm Yujia, an incoming first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University. I was an undergrad at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Diyi Yang. 

## Research Interest

My research interests center on investigating the limits of AI systems and building ML-based sociotechnical systems 
for marginalized communities.
