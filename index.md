## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="image.jpg">

Hi! I'm Yujia. I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Harini Suresh](https://harinisuresh.com/). Previously, I did my undergrad at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). 

My research investigates ways to make AI more participatory. Specifically, I am interested in designing grassroots, participatory, commuity-driven AI-based systems that are developed with and owned by marginalized communities, as well as developing tools and processes that enable stakeholder engagements throughout the entire AI development lifecycle.

Outside of research, you can find me climbing rocks, doing pottery, or hanging out with my cats.
